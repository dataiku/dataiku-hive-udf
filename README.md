# Dataiku Hive UDFs

This is a collection of UDF and Storage Handlers for [Apache Hive](http://apache.hive.org).

## Available UDFs

### Array operations

#### array_count_distinct

    int array_count_distinct(array<string>)

Counts the number of distinct values in the array

#### array_count_equals

    int array_count_equals(array<int> haystack, int needle)
    int array_count_equals(array<double> haystack, double needle)
    int array_count_equals(array<string> haystack, string needle)

Returns the number of times the needle is present in the haystack

#### collect_to_array

This is an aggregation function that gathers all input values and outputs them as an array.

For example

    table page_views {
        int visitor_id;
        string page;
    }

The query:

    select collect_to_array(page) from page_views group by visitor_id;

produces: `array<string>`, the list of pages viewed for each visitor_id

#### array_join

    array<TYPE> array_join(array<array<TYPE> >)

Joins an array of arrays into a single array containing all elements.
This is often used in combination with collect_to_array

For example, if you have:

    table A {
        int product_id;
        int day;
        array<string> buying_customers;
    }

collect_to_array(buying_customers) will therefore produce array<array<string>>

To get the full list of customers for one product, you can use:

    SELECT array_join(collect_to_array(buying_customers)) FROM A GROUP BY product_id;

### Map operations

#### count_to_map

Convert an array<string> to a map<string,int>, with a count of number of elements


    count_to_map<["yes", "no", "yes"]>  => {"yes":2,"no":1}

### count_distinct_map

For a group, generate a map with key from a secondary column counting the distinct values from keys from a third one. 


    select query, count_distinct_map(country, userid) as nusers_per_country FROM queries GROUP BY query; 

    query     country    userid
    FOO    FR    X
    FOO    FR    X
    FOO    FR    Y
    FOO    EN    Z 

    =>  FOO,  {"FR":2, EN:1}


### map_filter_lower_than

Filter a map<string,int>, keep only map entries where value is greater of equals to the provided argument

    map_filter_lower_than({"yes":2, "no":1}, 2) => {"yes":2}


### map_filter_top_n

Filter a map<string, int>, keep only the top N map entries according to the value. In case of equality, a random
selection of the elements is performed

    map_filter_top_n({"yes":2, "no":1, "maybe":2, "surely":5}, 3) => {"surely":5, "maybe":2, "yes":2}

## map_group_sum

Aggregating operation on map<string,int> than performs the unions of keys of the map, and sum the value when a key
exists in multiples maps


    CREATE TABLE docs (
        docid int;
        word_count map<string, int>
    )

    SELECT map_group_sum(word_count) FROM docs; ## Get the global word frequency

## map_group_sum2

Aggregating operation on map<char,double> than performs the unions of keys of the map, and sum the value when a key
exists in multiples maps


    CREATE TABLE docs (
        docid int;
        commission_amounts map<char(3), double>
    )

    SELECT map_group_sum2(commission_amounts) FROM docs; ## Get the total commissions

### Maths

### UDFExponentialSmoothingMovingAverage.

    moving_avg(period, value, window, divisor, position)
Compute the moving average on a column for a particular position.

Example:

    p   v
    4	40
    5	60
    6	0
    7	10
    8	20
    9	50
    10	100
    11	10

moving_avg(p, v, 4, 2, 11) return:
    mean(10 * 1/(2^1) + 100 * 1/(2^2) +  50 * 1/(2^3) +  20 * 1/(2^4))

moving_avg(p, v, 2, 3, 11) return:
    mean(10 * 1/(3^1) + 100 * 1/(3^2))

If a p is missing the value is put at 0.
moving_avg(p, v, 2, 3, 12) return:
    mean(0 * 1/(3^1) + 10 * 1/(3^2))


### Windowing functions

#### Rank

    int rank(string in)
    
While processing a stream of rows, rank will return the number of times it has previously seen the same value of `in`.

For example, while processing a table:
   
    table a {
        string data;
    }
    
with values:

    p1
    p1
    p2
    p2
    p2
    p3
    p4

The query:

    select data, rank(data) from a;

would return:

    p1   0
    p1   1
    p2   0
    p2   1
    p2   2
    p3   0
    p4   0
    
Therefore, rank only makes sense on a sorted table.

rank is very useful for sequence analysis

##### first_of_group, last_of_group

This is an aggregation function.

    TYPE1 first_of_group(TYPE1 outColumn, TYPE2 sortColumn)
    TYPE1 last_of_group(TYPE1 outColumn, TYPE2 sortColumn)
    
For each group, these functions will sort the rows of the group by `sortColumn`, and then 
output the value of `outColumn` for the first (resp. last) row, once sorted.

These functions are very useful for processing tables with "updates".

For example:

    table user {
        int id;
        int version;
        string email;
        string location;
    }

To get the last recorded location for a given user, you can use:

    select last_of_group(location, version) FROM user GROUP BY id;

You can use several first_of_group/last_of_group in the same query:

    select last_of_group(location, version), last_of_group(email, version) FROM user GROUP BY id;



## Storage Handlers

### XMLHiveStorageHandler


XMLHiveStorageHandler creates a table backed by one or multiple XML Files.

In the example below my_dir should contain XML Files contains a <MyTag> tag.
A Table will be created with one line per tag, with the raw XML content of each tag inside.

    CREATE TABLE my_table (text string)
    STORED BY 'com.dataiku.hive.storage.XMLHiveStorageHandler'
    LOCATION '/my_dir'
    TBLPROPERTIES (
        "xml.tag"="MyTag"
    )

Note that the storage handler does not perform any XML entity substitution (such as &gt; or unicode entities)
